        <h1>Channels to Log Guidelines for Station Loggers</h1>
        <p>This topic describes guidelines for the Channels to Log section in the Launch window for Station loggers.</p>
        <p>Some 
 general information is given below, but you should always refer to the 
 documentation that came with your logger for detailed information about 
 the channels that are available to you.</p>
        <h3>Maximum Channels</h3>
        <p>Do not attach more than 15 channels of sensors. 
 The logger cannot accommodate more than 15 channels.</p>
        <h3>Battery Channel</h3>
        <p>In addition to logging up to 15 channels, the 
HOBO Energy Logger Pro and HOBO U30 Station can record their internal battery channel. (Other 
 sensors must be attached; the logger cannot log battery alone.) 
 The logger's battery voltage is recorded at each interval. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Like the other data channels, logging the internal battery channel consumes 
 some of the logger's memory. Unless you are using excitation power or 
 suspect abnormal battery performance, you probably do not need to log 
 the battery voltage in loggers other than the HOBO&#160;U30 Station.</p>
        <h3>Excitation Power</h3>
        <p>Always enable the logger's internal battery channel 
 when logging with excitation power. This will enable you to determine 
 whether and when excitation power was turned off during a deployment.</p>
