        <p>If you are using a trial version of HOBOware, the License Key Manager dialog will indicate how much time you have remaining in your trial period. When the trial expires you will be prompted to enter a license key before you can continue using HOBOware.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE</b>:&#160;If you are updating an existing version of HOBOware you will not need to enter a license key.</p>
