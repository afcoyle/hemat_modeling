*Installation*
To install LogUtil, go to the logutil directory 
(cd c:\boxcar3\logutil) and type "logutil_" to expand LogUtil.
Then, type "logutil" to run LogUtil. (Please substitute the 
name of your hard drive for c:\ in the commands above as 
appropriate.)

*Main Menu*
At program startup, you are presented with the Main 
Menu. Return to this menu at any time from the 'Choice:' prompt by 
typing ?. When there is a logger file currently loaded into memory,
the Main Menu changes to give you additional options: Display Data,
Export Data, File Information, and Save Datafile as BoxCar File.
When there are no points in the data file, the Display
Data and Export Data features are not displayed.

*Launch*
When you select L: Launch from the Main Menu, LogUtil will display the
logger's description and the current date, time and reading. If the
time displayed is not correct, exit LogUtil and reset your 
computer's clock before launching loggers. For more information on
the launch features, refer to your BoxCar for Windows User's Guide.
After setting the launch parameters for your experiment, press S to
start the logger.

*Readout*
To read out data from your logger, select R:
Readout from the Main Menu. When LogUtil completes reading 
data from a logger, it presents general information about the 
logger and asks you to save the data. If you don't choose to save
the data at this time, later you can choose D:Display the data, 
E:Export it to a text file, or S:Save it as a BoxCar file.

*Shuttle Readout*
To read out data from an Optic Shuttle, select U:Shuttle Readout
at the Main Menu.  LogUtil will instruct you to connect the
logger to the specified port and press the button.  If the port
specified is not correct, Cancel out of the Shuttle Readout and use
the P:Change Port command to change the port. Once the Shuttle's
files have been offloaded, LogUtil will reset the shuttle's 
time to the computer's time, warning you if there was a discrepancy
between the two times. Then it will display the file information
for each file and ask you if you wish to save the file as a BoxCar
file.  If you do not choose to save the files, you will **not** be
able to save the files later unless you read out the Shuttle again.

*HOBO Shuttle Readout*
This function lets you read out data files (possibly many) from a
HOBO Shuttle. Since the function of Onset's HOBO Shuttle family 
(including the H-9 & H-10 HOBO shuttles) is to archive data files 
from other loggers, you are prompted individually to save each
data file in the shuttle. This process is similar to the one 
described above for the Optic shuttle. This feature will also warn
you of any discrepancy between the computer's and the Shuttle's 
time base.

*Open File*
You can open files previously saved as BoxCar files (*.DTF) by
selecting O: Open File from the Main Menu. Specify the path (if
necessary) and filename that contains your data and LogUtil
will open it and display the File Information. If you return to
the Main Menu, there are other options now available to view your
data.

*Current Time and Value*
If you select C: Current Time and Value from the Main Menu, the
Utility will attempt to connect to a logger and display the current
time (from the computer's system clock) and the current value from
the logger in the selected unit.

**NOTE**
The logger does not log in this mode and if it was 
logging it will STOP. Prolonged use of this mode will 
result in a shorter battery life for the logger.

*Change Port*
To select the port LogUtil will use when looking for a logger,
select P: Change Port from the Main Menu. The current port setting
is displayed, (1 is the default); the P: options lets you change 
this setting. This setting is *not* saved when you leave the 
Utility. Another way to set the port is to do it when you begin the
Utility by using the /p flag. For example, to start LogUtil and
set the port to COM2:

c:\> logutil /p2



****** Options available once you have a datafile open ******

*Display Data*
To view your data, select Display Data. Choose the unit you would like to display.  
Then you navigate through the data using P for the previous page, S to stop 
viewing the data, N to display without page breaks, or any other 
key to proceed to the next page.


*Export Data*
To export your data to an ASCII text file, choose the following 
command from the Main Menu:

	E: Export Data 

From there you will be given the choice of selecting the MS-Excel 
defaults (Excel time/date format and tab separated columns), the 
Lotus 123 defaults (Lotus time/date format and comma separated 
columns) or customizing the export.  Then you will be asked to 
choose which units to export.  Be sure to save your file with the 
.TXT extension to ensure easier importing into your spreadsheet 
package.

*File Information*
To view information about the current data such as Serial Number, 
Start and end date, number of samples, etc., choose the following 
from the Main Menu :

	I: File Information


*Save Datafile as BoxCar File*
With LogUtil you can save your data file as a BoxCar (version 
3.0 and above) compatible file after you have read out a logger. 
When you read out a new logger, the old information from the 
previous logger is erased from memory, so save the data file before
reading out new information from other loggers. To Save a file, 
choose 

	S: Save Datafile as a BoxCar File 

from the main menu. LogUtil does not automatically add an 
extension to the filename, so we recommend you use the .DTF 
extension to identify your data files as BoxCar files.

Special Notes for Version upgrades of Logutil

* The following information applies to LogUtil versions 3.0, 3.5 & 3.6.

Starting with version 3.0, LogUtil has been upgraded to support 
additional loggers by Onset Computer. The following loggers have been added:

	1. The HOBO Event Logger: A logger which stores time when
	an event occurs.
	2. The HOBO State Logger: Stores the time of a state
	transistion.
	3. The HOBO Shuttle: Reads and stores multiple data files,
	possibly from more than one HOBO.
	4. The H8: a multi-channel logger which can have up to four
	selectable channels.
	5. TidbiT: Contains no new features; is a different form of
	the Optic StowAway.
	6. The H-10 Shuttle: A HOBO Shuttle operating at a 38400 
	Baud rate.
	7. The HOBO Pro: H8 logger operating at 38400 Baud, with a
	64k data file size.
	
The following sections describe the features of these added 
loggers:

(The Optic StowAway, regular StowAway and the Tidbit can be 
considered as one logger, since they have the same launch features.)

HO8 - INTERNAL & SELECTABLE CHANNELS

The HO8  and HOBO pro SERIES loggers are unique among the loggers 
mentioned here. These logger families can support more than one 
channel. Look at the documentation of 
your HO8 or HOBO Pro logger for the exact layout of channels and sensors.

Before launching a multiple channel logger, a channel must be enabled from the main 
menu. Channels that are successfully enabled will display 'Yes' next to them on the launch menu.

The HO8 and HOBO Pro series loggers can have from one to four selectable channels. 
The channel is called selectable because you choose the sensor attached to 
this channel during launching. 

A selectable channel still needs to be enabled as does a regular
channel. However, it also must have a sensor attached to 
it. If the documentation for your particular HO8 (or HOBO Pro Series logger) 
indicates you have one or more Selectable channels, a list of the 
sensors available for the selectable channels will be displayed in the 
Launch menu. (Get to
the Launch menu by typing 'L' from the main menu.)

If you have an Selectable channel, enable it normally, then you will be prompted 
to connect a sensor to the channel. (Pick the number from the list of available sensors 
that is displayed.)


HOBO EVENT and HOBO STATE
The HOBO(R) Event and HOBO State loggers have some features not
possessed by other Onset loggers. For instance, the HOBO State has 
Open State string and Closed State string. The HOBO Event has 
Event Name, Event Value, and Lockout After Event. Below 
is some additional information about the special features  
of the HOBO Event and HOBO State loggers.

HOBO State Features 

Enter characters in the Open and Closed state fields to let you
provide descriptive information about the meaning of a state open
or a state close. Please refer to your HOBO State documentation 
for more information about open and closed states.


HOBO Event Features

Event name 
The HOBO (R) Event logger is used to log the time of a certain
"event." To give the event a descriptive title, use the Event Name 
option from the HOBO Event launch menu (accessed with 'L' from the 
main menu). LogUtil will use the name you provide to describe the 
event. 

Event value
The Event value can be entered by choosing the Event Value option 
(item 3 from the Event launch menu). This command prompts for an 
argument n; 'n' should be entered as a number in floating point.

Lockout after Event
The HOBO (R) Event logger is the only logger capable of Lockout
after Event. When an event occurs, the HOBO Event stores the 
current date and time in its memory. The term, 'time-stamp' is 
sometimes used to refer to this type of behavior. After an event, 
you may want to stop recording events for a specified time to let 
characteristics in the experiment environment settle. If so, use 
the lockout after event feature. The LogUtil program will prompt 
you for a lockout interval in hours minutes and seconds format. 
Days are not required (and they are not accepted) by this command.
