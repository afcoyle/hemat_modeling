        <h1><a name="kanchor22"></a>Connecting Multiple Devices</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>If your computer has multiple USB and serial ports, you can connect multiple devices and work with one at a time (HOBOware Lite can only be used for USB&#160;Ports). 
 When multiple devices
 are connected, the <b>Select Device</b> window opens every time you select 
 <i>Launch</i>, <i>Readout</i>, <i>Stop</i>, or <i>Status</i> from the Main Menu.</p>
        <p>Click the button next to a device on the list to select it, then 
 click <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span>. The selected action will proceed.</p>
        <p>To access the<b> Select Device</b> window at any time, click the <b>Select Device</b> 
 icon  on the toolbar, or choose <span style="font-weight: bold;">Select 
 Device</span> from the <b>Device </b>menu <img src="../Resources/Images/device.gif" />.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">With HOBOware Pro, if you work with multiple U-Series devices 
 frequently, you can set the <b>Default Action</b> to <i>Launch </i>(Device menu) and enable Launch Time-Saving Options to work more efficiently. </p>
        <p><b>NOTE (HOBOware Pro)</b>: If serial devices are selected in Preferences, it may take some time for HOBOware Pro to scan all of the serial ports. You can select the device you want as soon as it is displayed. You do not have to wait for all of the ports to be scanned.</p>
        <h2>Verifying Selected Device</h2>
        <p>If the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor23"></a>Blink Device Light</span> button 
 is available, you can click it to verify that you have selected the appropriate device. 
 This briefly illuminates the light on the devices that you have selected. </p>
        <p>If the device
 does not have a light, or if the light is not visible when the devices is in the base station/coupler, 
 simply check the serial number (S/N) on your devices to make sure that it matches the 
 one that is selected in this window.</p>
        <p>When the <b>Select Device</b> window is not open, you can check the status 
 bar at the bottom of the screen to quickly determine which device is selected. The left side of 
 the status bar indicates the model, description, and serial number of 
 the device; 
 the right side indicates the total number of devices connected.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions=""><b>NOTE</b> (HOBOware Pro): Serial devices that you have added or removed are not reflected in the device count until you click the <b>Select Device</b> icon on the toolbar to update the device list.</p>
