        <h1>Key Features</h1>
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>Analysis functions can be used to extract key information from logged data. These functions actually create new data series, which can be graphed or exported. These functions filter data over user-specified intervals that can be in seconds, minutes, hours or days. The Subset Statistics tool (included with HOBOware) calculates statistics over a user-defined interval.
</p>
        <h2>Time Saving Options</h2>
        <h3>Launching</h3>
        <p>By default, HOBOware Pro displays the launch window when you initiate a launch. If you want to skip the launch window and launch the logger with the default settings, choose Automatically launch. 
This is particularly useful if you want to launch many loggers quickly without changing any settings.</p>
        <p>For more information see Launch Time Saving Options.</p>
        <h3>Readout</h3>
        <h2>Viewing Subset Statistics</h2>
        <p>The Subset Statistics feature allows you to select a range of data in a graph, and display the maximum, minimum, average and standard deviation for the measurements in that range.</p>
        <p>See <a href="../Graphs/view_sub-stats.htm">Viewing Subset Statistics</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <h3>The Alarm and Readout Tool</h3>
        <p>The Alarm and Readout Tool is designed to continuously monitor critical areas, and allow you to receive instant notification if conditions exceed limits using this enhancement to HOBOware® Pro.</p>
        <h3>The Bulk Export Tool </h3>
        <p>The Bulk Export Tool makes it easy to export data from many logger data files at once. This tool is a free add-on for HOBOware Pro.</p>
        <h2>Data Assistants</h2>
        <p>HOBOware Pro Data Assistants let you create new data series by combining data recorded 
 by the logger with additional data that you enter before you display the 
 plot. For example, the kWh Assistant converts logged pulse data from an 
 energy transducer to kWh, average kW, and energy cost.</p>
        <h2>21 CFR Part 11 Conformance

Bulk File Export Tool provides an easy way of exporting many data files at once.
