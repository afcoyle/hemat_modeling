        <h1><a name="kanchor33"></a>Launch Parameters for Station Loggers</h1>
        <p>This topic explains the elements in the <a href="../Launch_window_serial.htm">Launch window for station loggers</a>.</p>
        <h2>Field/Description</h2>
        <h3>Logger Type</h3>
        <p>Logger model and description.</p>
        <h3>Serial Number</h3>
        <p>Serial number of the logger. Note that some external sensors also have 
 serial numbers, which are not listed here.</p>
        <h3>Deployment Number</h3>
        <p>Number of times (including this time) the logger has been launched. 
 Each time you start a new launch, the deployment number increases by one.</p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Enter a description for the launch, up to 40 characters, in this field. 
 This description is used as the default file name when you read out and 
 save the data recorded by the logger. It is also the title of the graph.</p>
        <h3>Channels To Log</h3>
        <p>Review and <a href="../select_module.htm">configure</a> the data channels, 
 if any, you want the logger to record. If you do not select any channels to log, the 
 logger will record <a href="../Graphs/plotting-data.htm">states and events</a> 
 only.</p>
        <p>Only the sensors that are currently plugged in or built into the logger are listed. Sensors are listed in ascending order by serial 
 number, regardless of their position in the logger. If you add or remove sensors, click the Refresh button to make sure your changes are seen by the logger.&#160;</p>
        <p>Although it is helpful to see the connected sensors when setting up the launch, it is not required that you connect the sensors during launch set-up (though they do need to be connected if you want to define locations or configure FlexSmart modules or Analog Sensor Ports). You may set up the launch for a delayed or trigger start, then connect the sensors later, before logging begins.</p>
        <p>Double-click a sensor name (or click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Set Location</span> button while a sensor name 
 is selected) to enter a location string, up to 30 characters, that provides 
 useful information about the sensor for this deployment.</p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Device/chnls-to-log-st.htm">Channels to Log Guidelines for Station Loggers</a>.</p>
        <h3>Wrap Around When Full</h3>
        <p>You have the option to allow station-type loggers to wrap and continue logging 
 after the memory has filled up. The newly logged information will overwrite 
 the oldest logged information. Check this box if you want the logger to 
 continue logging, overwriting the older data, instead of stopping when 
 full.</p>
        <h3>User Notes</h3>
        <p>You may enter up to 2000 characters of information about the deployment. 
 This text will be displayed in the Details pane after you read out the 
 logger and display the data.</p>
        <h3>Logging Interval</h3>
        <p><a name="kanchor34"></a>Choose the rate at which you want the logger to record data. The minimum 
 logging interval is one second and the maximum for most loggers is 18 
 hours, 12 minutes, and 15 seconds. The shorter the logging interval, the 
 more quickly the memory fills and battery power is consumed.&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor35"></a>Some sensors (specifically, the FlexSmart TRMS modules) require a logging 
 interval of two seconds or greater. If you choose a faster logging interval, 
 erroneous data will be logged on these channels.</p>
        <h3>Sampling Interval</h3>
        <p>The sampling interval allows you to take multiple measurements within 
 the logging interval, then average them together to create a single logged 
 measurement.&#160;</p>
        <p>The sampling interval is optional, and is valid only for sensors with measurement averaging. Refer to the sensor's user manual to determine 
 whether measurement averaging is available on the sensor. If you have at least 
 one sensor that supports measurement averaging, check the box to enable 
 measurement averaging, then set the sampling interval at less than or 
 equal to the logging interval (up to four minutes). Rapid sampling (faster 
 than one minute) will reduce the logger's battery life. </p>
        <p>If you do not have any sensors with measurement averaging, uncheck 
 the box to disable the sampling interval and avoid unnecessary strain 
 on the logger's battery.</p>
        <h3>Logging Duration</h3>
        <p>Approximate time it would take to fill the logger's memory based on 
 the logging interval and the currently connected and enabled sensors, 
 if applicable. <span style="font-style: italic;">This is a theoretical 
 estimate only;</span> battery life will affect your deployment. In addition, 
 if you plan to connect additional sensors before logging begins (i.e. 
 while awaiting a trigger or delayed start), the estimate will not be correct.&#160;</p>
        <p>If you add or remove sensors while viewing the Launch window, click 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh</span> button to get an updated 
 Logging Duration. </p>
        <h3>Launch Options</h3>
        <p>The <span style="font-weight: normal;">Launch Option</span> defaults to 
 the setting for the logger's previous launch. To have all loggers default to the same launch option, see <a href="../Preferences/gp-lnch-ts.htm">Launch Time-Saving Options</a> (HOBOware Pro only).</p>
        <p><b>NOTE</b>:&#160;For additional details on launching the HOBO&#160;U30 Station, see <a href="../Device/u30-station.htm">Working with the HOBO&#160;U30 Station</a> on page <a href="../Device/u30-station.htm" target="" title="" alt="" class="MCXref_page">on page 1</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="margin-left: 40px;font-weight: normal;"><i>Now</i>: Logging begins as soon as you click the Launch</span> 
 button. <span style="margin-left: 40px;font-weight: bold;"></span>If you do not have at least one sensor attached, the logger 
 will not launch.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">At Interval</span>: Logging will begin at an exact interval (for example 9:00:00 rather than 
 8:47:00 when you choose a one-hour logging interval). The exact start 
 time depends on the logging interval you choose.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">Delayed</span>: Logging will begin at a date and time you specify.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><a name="kanchor36"></a><span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">Trigger</span>: Logging will not start until you press the button on the logger and hold 
 it down, or perform some other action as described in the logger manual. 
 If the logger has a light, the light will flash quickly when logging begins. This is not available for the U30 Station.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">Save Settings</span>: Logging will not start, but the launch settings will be saved so that 
 you do not have to re-enter them when you are ready to launch at a later 
 time. The next time you view the Launch window for this logger, the settings 
 you entered will still be in place.</p>
        <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Skip launch window next time</h3>
        <p>Check this box if you would like to bypass the Launch Window the next time 
 you choose <span style="font-weight: bold;">Launch</span> from the Device 
 menu or click the Launch icon. This will cause the next 
 logger to be launched with default settings, as determined by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fill launch window with contents of</span> 
 preference.&#160;To turn this setting off so that you can access 
 the Launch window again, go to <b>Preferences </b>&gt; <b>General </b>&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Launch 
 Time-Saving Options</span> and in the <i>When Launching</i> drop-down list select "Show launch screen".&#160;</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">To always use the settings from the logger's memory, you can 
 return to the default setting by going to <b>Preferences </b>&gt; <b>General </b>&gt;&#160;<b>Launch Time-Saving Options</b> and choose 
 <span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">Fill launch window with contents of Current 
 logger</span>.</p>
