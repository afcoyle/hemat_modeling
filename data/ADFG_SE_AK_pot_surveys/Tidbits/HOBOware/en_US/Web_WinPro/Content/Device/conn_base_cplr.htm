        <h1><a name="kanchor20"></a>Connecting a Base Station or Coupler</h1>
        <p>Some loggers require an optic USB base station/coupler or serial cable to connect to the computer. Consult the manual that came with your device for specific information about required base stations/couplers or cables.
</p>
        <p><b>NOTES (Windows Only)</b>: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">If you are connecting a base station/coupler or logger that has never been connected to this computer before, it may take some time for the computer to detect the new hardware and report that it has connected successfully. One or more messages will appear, indicating that new hardware has been found. You may also hear a chime.
</li>
            <li value="2"><b></b> You may be prompted to reboot you computer before you can use the logger. It is not necessary to reboot.
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>To connect a logger to a base station/coupler:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="sp_bull" value="1">Open HOBOware.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="2">Plug the base station/coupler cable into a USB 
 port on the computer. </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> 
 Make sure the base/station coupler is the correct model for the logger 
 you want to use. Consult the manual that came with the logger if you are 
 not sure.</p>
        <ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="sp_bull" value="3">Attach the logger to the base station/coupler 
 as described in the documentation that came with your logger.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When the logger is recognized by HOBOware, 
 the right side of the status bar at the bottom of the HOBOware window will update to reflect the 
 number of loggers connected. At this point, you can begin using the logger.</p>
        <p>To disconnect a logger, simply unplug it from 
 the base station/coupler. Wait for the status bar to update the number 
 of devices before continuing.</p>
        <p>To attach another logger via a base station/coupler, 
 remove the logger, leaving the base station/coupler connected. Then connect 
 the next logger.</p>
