        <h1>Advanced HOBOware Pro Features</h1>
        <h2>Setup Assistant</h2>
        <p>When you open HOBOware Pro for the first time, you are greeted by the 
 HOBOware Setup Assistant, a series of dialogs intended to help you quickly
change some key preference settings for device types and serial ports, units
of measurement, and data assistants. See <a href="HOBOware_setup_assistant.htm">HOBOware Pro Setup Assistant</a> for more information.    <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>Analysis features can be used to extract key information from logged data. You can create new data series, which can be graphed or exported. You can also filter data over user-specified intervals that can be in seconds, minutes, hours or days. The Subset Statistics tool (included with HOBOware Pro) calculates statistics over a user-defined interval.
</p>
        <h2>Plug-in Tools&#160;</h2>
        <p>Plug-in tools for HOBOware Pro provide additional functionality. For example, the Real-Time Alarm Software monitors HOBO data loggers and notifies you when sensor and logger conditions fall outside the limits you specify.
For instructions on installing and using plug-in tools, refer to the tool’s user guide (located on the CD or web page where you downloaded the tool).
</p>
        <h2>Time Saving Options</h2>
        <h3>Launching</h3>
        <p>By default, HOBOware Pro displays the launch window when you initiate a launch. If you want to skip the launch window and launch the logger with the default settings, choose <i>Automatically launch</i>. 
This is particularly useful if you want to launch many loggers quickly without changing any settings.</p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Preferences/gp-lnch-ts.htm">Launch Time Saving Options</a>.</p>
        <h3>Readout</h3>
        <p>This feature allows you to skip a number of default actions when reading out a logger (such as being prompted to saving or  the Plot Setup dialog).</p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Preferences/gp-read-tso.htm">Readout Time Saving Options</a>.</p>
        <h2>Viewing Subset Statistics</h2>
        <p>The Subset Statistics feature allows you to select a range of data in a graph, and display the maximum, minimum, average and standard deviation for the measurements in that range.</p>
        <p>See <a href="../Graphs/view_sub-stats.htm">Viewing Subset Statistics</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <h3>The Alarm and Readout Tool</h3>
        <p>The Alarm and Readout Tool is designed to continuously monitor critical areas, and allow you to receive instant notification if conditions exceed limits using this enhancement to HOBOware® Pro.</p>
        <h3>The Bulk Export Tool </h3>
        <p>The Bulk Export Tool makes it easy to export data from many logger data files at once. This tool is a free add-on for HOBOware Pro.</p>
        <h2>Data Assistants</h2>
        <p>HOBOware Pro Data Assistants let you create new data series by combining data recorded 
 by the logger with additional data that you enter before you display the 
 plot. For example, the kWh Assistant converts logged pulse data from an 
 energy transducer to kWh, average kW, and energy cost.</p>
        <p>All Data Assistants can be run from the <b>Plot Setup</b> window after you readout a logger or open a datafile. With this method you need to run the Data Assistant each time you readout the logger or open a datafile.</p>
        <p>Some Data Assistants (Pulse Scaling, Linear Scaling, kWh) can also be run from the <b>Launch</b> window,  so that parameters are applied automatically each time you readout the logger or open a data file. Once you have pre-defined a parameter set, the pre-set parameters are also used when current readings are viewed in the Status window.  This feature is available for the HOBO U30, the HOBO&#160;H21 (Weather Station and Micro Station) and the HOBO&#160;H22 (Energy Logger Pro) loggers.</p>
        <p>For more information see <a href="../Data Files/Data_assistants.htm">HOBOware Pro Data Assistants</a>.</p>
