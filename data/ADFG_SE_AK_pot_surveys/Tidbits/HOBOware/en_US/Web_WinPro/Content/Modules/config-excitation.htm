        <h1>Configuring Excitation Power</h1>
        <p><b>NOTE</b>:&#160;Analog Sensor Port Configuration is only available with HOBOware Pro.</p>
        <h2>Description
</h2>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>You can configure sensor excitation power and warmup on the Analog Sensor Ports. Sensor excitation is a voltage output provided by the HOBO U30 Station to power a sensor that is connected to it. This power may be needed because the sensor is not self-powered, or because the sensor’s power capacity cannot support a long deployment.
</p>
        <p>When sensor excitation is required, the logger can provide 12 V DC sensor excitation voltage up to 200 mA total for transducers that require external power for proper operation. The excitation voltage has a programmable warmup time and is controlled by the Analog Sensor Port.
</p>
        <p>A warm up time can be up to 120 seconds. If the warm up required is 
 longer than 120 seconds, or if you are not concerned with battery life, 
 you may choose the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Continuous</span> 
 option, which will power the sensor for the entire deployment. Then click 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> to return to the Configure 
 Channel dialog.
</p>
        <h3>Battery Life
</h3>
        <p>Providing excitation power drastically decreases the logger's battery 
 life. (Consult the logger manual for more information.) In order to save 
 battery power, you may specify the minimum time needed to power the sensor 
 before taking a measurement. For example, if you specify a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Warm 
 Up</span> of one second and set the logging interval in the logger to 
 one minute, the logger will power the external sensor for one second, 
 log data and then turn off the excitation power for the next 59 seconds.</p>
        <p> 
 Always enable the logger's internal battery channel when logging with 
 excitation power. If the battery becomes too low to provide excitation 
 power, excitation power is turned off, but logging continues as long as 
 the battery can power the logger. This will cause the further readings 
 on that channel to become inaccurate. If you are logging the internal 
 battery channel when this happens, an Excitation Off event will be shown 
 in your datafile to mark the point at which excitation power was disabled.</p>

        <h2>Modes
</h2>
        <h3>Warm up
</h3>
        <p>When in Warm up Mode the logger supplies excitation power for a brief, user-programmable period prior to each measurement. This mode allows you to select the minimum warm up time needed to allow for sensor stabilization, while conserving battery power.
</p>
        <p>For example, if you specify a warm up of one second and set the Logging Interval to one minute, the HOBO U30 Station will power the external sensor for one second, log a measurement, and then turn off the excitation power for the next 59 seconds. The warm up time can be up to 120 seconds.
</p>
        <p>If the warm up time selected is greater than the logging interval selected, the logger will interpret the excitation mode as continuous.
</p>
        <h3>Continuous
</h3>
        <p>When in Continuous Mode the logger supplies constant excitation power to the sensor for the entire duration of the deployment. This mode will result in reduced battery life. Continuous mode is required if the sensor needs more than two minutes of warm up time.

</p>
        <p>The Analog Sensor Ports begin functioning when logging begins. When the ports are functioning correctly, the Active indicator LED on the port blinks once per logging interval to indicate that a successful measurement has been made. The
Ex. On
indicator LED will also be lit when excitation is enabled.
