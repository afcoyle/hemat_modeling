        <h1><a name="kanchor122"></a>The Hand&#160;Tool</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Use the hand tool to move different areas of the graph into view or 
 adjust the position of one series so it can be viewed more easily. This 
 is particularly useful when you are zoomed into the graph and want to 
 see another section of the graph without zooming out and then zooming 
 back in on the new location.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE</b>:&#160;Panning will not work on an axis that is locked. To unlock an axis, 
 double-click the axis with the arrow tool and clear the checkmark next 
 to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lock Axis Scaling and Tick Marks</span>.</p>
        <h2>Using the Hand Tool</h2>
        <p> There are two ways to select the hand tool: 
 </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li value="1">Click the Hand icon <img src="../Resources/Images/hand.gif" /> on the toolbar; 
 or</li>
            <li value="2">Press the <span style="font-weight: bold;">H</span> 
 key on your keyboard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Pan Across Graph</h3>
        <p>Click within the graph and hold down the left 
 mouse button to pan a different section of the graph into view. The graph 
 follows the movement of the mouse, and the axes are continuously updated 
 in response to the movement. To stop dragging, release the left mouse 
 button.</p>
        <h3>Restrict Motion</h3>
        <p>Hold down the <span style="font-weight: bold;">X</span> 
 key while dragging to restrict motion horizontally. Hold down the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Y</span> key while dragging to restrict motion 
 vertically.</p>
        <h3>Pan One Sseries at a time</h3>
        <p>Click the axis associated 
 with the series and hold down the left mouse button. Only the series connected 
 with the axis will follow the movement of the mouse.<b></b></p>
