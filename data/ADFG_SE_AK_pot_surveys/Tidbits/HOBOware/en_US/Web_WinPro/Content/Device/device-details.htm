        <h3>Battery Level/Battery State</h3>
        <p>Condition of the battery. Consult the logger documentation for specifics 
 on battery capacity.</p>
        <h3>Memory Used</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Percentage 
 of the logger's memory that is full. </span>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> 
 If the battery died while the logger was logging, this will be 100% even 
 if only a small amount of the memory was used.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="">Wrap Around When Full (HOBOware Pro Only)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li MadCap:conditions="" value="1"> <![CDATA[ ]]><span style="font-weight: normal;">Enabled</span></li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="" value="2"> <![CDATA[ ]]><span style="font-weight: normal;">Disabled</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="">Wrap Count</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">For Station loggers only, this indicator lists the number of times the 
 logger has wrapped, if wrapping is enabled.</p>
        <h3>Current Status</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Messages 
 that describe the state of the logger.</span>
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">For the HOBO U30 Station (HOBOware Pro only) the current state of the relay is also noted. After the state of the logger, the message “Relay is open” or “Relay is closed” will display.</p>

            <li class="sp_bull" value="1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor100"></a>Awaiting Button/Coupler 
 Start</span> <![CDATA[ ]]><br />The logger has been launched with a trigger start (if available). 
 Press and hold down the button on the logger for three seconds to begin 
 logging, or follow the instructions that came with your logger if it offers 
 a triggered start but does not have a button. If the logger has a light, 
 the light will flash quickly when logging begins.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Awaiting Delayed 
 Start</span>
                <br />The logger will begin recording data at a specific time 
 because either <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delayed Start</span> or 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start at Interval</span> was chosen at 
 launch.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Launched, Logging</span>
                <br />The logger has been launched and is actively recording data.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Logger Is Full</span>
                <br /> 
 The logger has reached its memory capacity and is no longer recording 
 data. </li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="5"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Logger is stopped</span>
                <br />The logger is not logging, is not full, and is not awaiting a delayed 
 or trigger start. </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="" class="sp_bull" value="6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">On 
 Hold for Later Launch</span> (HOBOware Pro only)<br />The logger has been launched with a Save 
 Settings start (if available). Logging is not scheduled to begin, but 
 the launch settings have been entered and saved.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="">Last Launched</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">Date, time, and offset to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), also known as Coordinated 
 Universal Time (UTC), when the logger was last launched. This is not necessarily 
 the time when the first sample was recorded; it is the time all of the 
 launch parameters were loaded in the logger.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="">Delayed Start <span style="font-style: italic;">(if applicable)</span></h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">If the logger has been launched, but is waiting for a delayed or interval 
 start, the scheduled start time is shown here in local time.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="">Deployment Number</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">Number of times the logger has been launched. The number listed includes 
 the most recent launch.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="">Logging Interval</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">Rate at which the logger was set up to record data the last time the 
 logger was launched, if applicable. If multiple logging 
 intervals are available for your logger, the interval currently in use (if the logger is logging) will 
 be shown in bold.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="">Sampling Interval (HOBOware Pro only)</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">For station loggers only, this is the sampling interval that was entered 
 the last time the logger was launched, if applicable.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="">Current States<span style="font-style: italic;" MadCap:conditions=""> (U-Series loggers except the U30)</span></h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">If your logger has an event button, most often the current state will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">Button Up,</span> meaning the button is not 
 being pressed.</p>
