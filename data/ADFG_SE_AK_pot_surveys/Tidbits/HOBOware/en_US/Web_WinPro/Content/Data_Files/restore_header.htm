        <h1><a name="kanchor29"></a>Read Header Failed Error</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">Occasionally, when trying to launch, check status, or read out a U-Series logger (other than a HOBO U30
Station), HOBO Waterproof Shuttle, or HOBO U Shuttle, you may receive the following error:&#160;"Read 
 Header Failed".</p>
        <p>These messages occur when a device's header 
 cannot be read, usually because of a communication error or corrupted 
 header. Disconnect the device from the computer, then reconnect it and 
 try to launch, check status, or read out again. </p>
        <p><a name="kanchor30"></a><a name="kanchor31"></a>If you receive the message again, the header has probably become corrupted. 
 The most common cause of header corruption is a communication problem 
 during launch, such as the USB cable coming loose or an optical logger 
 slipping out of its base station/coupler while the Launching Logger progress 
 bar is displayed. In that case, there is a possibility that valid data 
 has been logged, but cannot be read out.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">You can restore the header by launching the logger<span MadCap:conditions=""> or </span>shuttle. This will reset the device's launch options to factory defaults. However, 
 it will also cause any logged data or offloaded data from a shuttle to be lost. If you receive a "Read 
 Header Failed" message and are unable to read out the logger or offload a shuttle, please contact 
 the vendor that sold you the device. It may be possible to retrieve the 
 logged data.</p>
