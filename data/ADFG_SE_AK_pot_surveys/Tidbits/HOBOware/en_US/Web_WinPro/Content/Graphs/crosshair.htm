        <h1><a name="kanchor118"></a>Using the Crosshair Tool</h1>
        <p><a name="kanchor119"></a>Use the crosshair tool to zero in on a specific date and time in the 
 plot and any data points associated with that date and time.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Select the crosshair tool:</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bodyindent">Click the Crosshair icon <img src="../Resources/Images/xhair.gif" /> on the 
 toolbar, or press the <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> 
 key on your keyboard</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li value="2">Click a point on the graph to mark it. </li>
            <li value="3">Click another point to 
 move the marker. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> When you click 
 on a graph, HOBOware selects the nearest data point. When 
 series are very close together, and the location you click is between 
 two points, it is possible that the nearest point is not on the series 
 you clicked. </p>
        <p>You can also mark the point on the graph by clicking the corresponding 
 cell in the Points table. </p>
        <h3>Scrolling</h3>
        <p>Normally, if 
 you are zoomed in and click a point in the Points table that is outside 
 the zoom area,  HOBOware<span style="vertical-align: Super;">&#160;</span>will scroll to the marked point's 
 area of the graph. If you do not want HOBOware to scroll, change the setting under 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Points Table &amp; Details Pane</span> 
 on the <a href="../Preferences/prefs-plotting.htm">Plotting preference</a> pane.</p>
        <h3>Changes to Plot</h3>
        <p>The plot changes in several ways when the crosshair is in use. The Points 
 pane shifts to the row that contains the data point. Where the crosshair 
 intersects a data point, a square surrounds the data point. The intersection 
 points are also marked by small color-coded arrows on the left and right 
 value axes. </p>
        <h2>Legend</h2>
        <p>If the legend is displayed next to the graph, the point values for each 
 series are updated to reflect the crosshair location. Values are listed 
 in the legend differently depending on whether the data is a logged sample, 
 state, or event:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="sp_bull" value="1">Values that are not in parentheses are actual 
 data points logged at the time selected by the crosshair.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="2">Values in parentheses are estimated because there 
 were no exact values for the series at the time selected by the crosshair. 
 Zoom in or move the crosshair to see actual values.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="3"><a name="kanchor120"></a>A value of "…" indicates that there 
 is no series data during the time selected. This is seen most frequently 
 for events. If the time selection falls within an event series, but does 
 not contain an event, parentheses surround the "…" value.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="4">A value of "logged" indicates an internal 
 logger event happened at the selected time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> 
 The legend must expand in height to list the point values. If your application 
 window is too small to accommodate the expanded height, the values will 
 not be added to the legend. You can still refer to the Points table to 
 find the values of the selected points.</p>
        <h2>Removing the Crosshair</h2>
        <p>To remove the crosshair from the graph, right-click on the graph and 
 select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove Crosshair</span> from the 
 pop-up menu. Or, choose <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove Crosshair</span> 
 from the View menu.</p>
