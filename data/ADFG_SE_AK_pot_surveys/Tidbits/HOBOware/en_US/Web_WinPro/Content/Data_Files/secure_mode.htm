        <h1>Working in Secure Mode<a name="kanchor93"></a><a name="kanchor94"></a></h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>You can create secure files in HOBOware Pro to comply with <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=11&amp;showfr=1">21 CFR Part 11</a>, or simply to add a level of security when working with datafiles. When Secure Mode is enabled, HOBOware Pro begins an audit trail in the logger when 
 you launch it, and adds an encoded digital signature to the new datafile 
 when you read it out.&#160;</p>
        <p>A digitally signed file, or "secure file," has a filename extension of .hsec (for most U-Series loggers) or .dsec (for 
 station-type loggers). </p>
        <p><b>NOTE</b>:&#160;You can <u>open</u> .dsec  files in HOBOware Lite but you can only create secure files in HOBOware Pro.<a href="http://www.onsetcomp.com/solutions/products/software/docs/HWPro2_3-21cfr.pdf"></a></p>
        <p MadCap:conditions=""><b>NOTE</b>:&#160;Issues 
 may arise if you do not always use HOBOware Pro in the Secure Mode, if you 
 sometimes use HOBOware Lite, or if you sometimes use a version of HOBOware 
 prior to 2.3.0. See <a href="secure_md-issues.htm">Security Mode Issues</a>.</p>

        <p MadCap:conditions=""><a href="http://www.onsetcomp.com/solutions/products/software/docs/HWPro2_3-21cfr.pdf">Using HOBOware Pro as part of 21 CFR&#160;Part II&#160;Systems (external .pdf)</a>

        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">Enabling Secure Mode (HOBOware Pro Only)&#160;</h2>
        <p>Secure Mode must be enabled to create a secure file.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE</b>:&#160;Project (.hproj) 
 and export files are not secure, even if you 
 create them from secure files.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor95"></a>To enable Secure mode:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Go to <b style="font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">Preferences </b>&gt;&#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">General</span>.</li>
            <li value="2">Select <span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">Enable Secure Mode</span>. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When Secure mode 
 is enabled, a padlock icon <img src="../Resources/Images/lock-small.gif" /> appears in the lower right corner 
 of the main HOBOware Pro window.</p>
        <h2>Opening a Secure File</h2>
        <p>Secure files can be opened with HOBOware Pro 2.3.0 or greater. You can open .hsec files only with HOBOware Lite 2.3.0 or greater.</p>
        <p>Every time you open a secure file – even when you are not in Secure 
 mode – HOBOware verifies 
 the encoded digital signature to detect whether the 
 file has been corrupted or tampered with. If even one bit of the data 
 has changed since readout, a warning message will appear when you open 
 the file, and none of the series will be marked as verified.</p>
        <p>The padlock icon <img src="../Resources/Images/lock-small.gif" /> appears 
 in the <a href="../Graphs/overview-graph.htm">legend</a> next to the series 
 that were verified as original data. </p>
        <p>In the <a href="../Reference/details.htm">Details</a> pane, audit trail information 
 is displayed under the Data Verification node for each series. HOBOware 
 Pro automatically obtains the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Launch 
 User</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Readout User</span> names 
 from your computer's operating system. To save the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Launch 
 User</span> name, you must have Secure Mode enabled when you launch the 
 logger.</p>
        <h3>Verification</h3>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="sp_bull" value="1">Series that were created by <a href="../filter.htm">filtering</a> 
 are not verified.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="2">Series that were created as a result of user input 
 after readout, such as running a <a href="Data_assistants.htm">data assistant</a> 
 or entering a constant temperature value for pressure or humidity, are 
 not verified.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="3">Series retain their verification status (and padlock 
 icon) when <a href="../Graphs/copy_series.htm">copied and pasted</a> into other 
 plots.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Verification Failure&#160;</h3>
        <p>If HOBOware cannot verify the digital 
 signature when you open a file, it will display a message that verification has failed. This 
 means that the file has been altered or become corrupted since it was 
 originally saved. It will offer to display the plot if possible, but will 
 not display the padlock icon in the legend or provide signing details 
 in the Details pane. You will still be able to perform 
 typical HOBOware functions on the file.</p>
