        <h1><a name="kanchor49"></a>HOBOware Pro Data Assistants</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><a name="kanchor50"></a>HOBOware Pro Data Assistants let you create new data series by combining data recorded 
 by the logger with additional <a href="#"></a>data that you enter before you display the 
 plot. For example, the kWh Assistant converts logged pulse data from an 
 energy transducer to kWh, average kW, and energy cost. </p>
        <p>All Data Assistants can be run from the <b>Plot Setup</b> window after you readout a logger or open a datafile. With this method you need to run the Data Assistant each time you readout the logger or open a datafile.</p>
        <p>Some Data Assistants (Pulse Scaling, Linear Scaling, kWh) can also be run from the <b>Launch</b> window,  so that parameters are applied automatically each time you readout the logger or open a data file. Once you have pre-defined a parameter set, the parameters are also used when current readings are viewed in the  window.  This feature is available for the HOBO U30, the HOBO&#160;H21 (Weather Station and Micro Station) and the HOBO&#160;H22 (Energy Logger Pro) loggers. Parameter sets are stored on the logger and apply to that logger and channel configuration only.</p>
        <p>The parameters last entered into any given Data Assistant will be the default used the next time the Data Assistant is run, unless it is being used to edit an existing parameter set.  If you run a Data Assistant at Plot Setup time, and the next time you run it from the <b>Launch</b> window, the default values are the value you entered at Plot Setup time.</p>
        <p>For an overview of each assistant, select the assistant and click the <b>What’s This?</b> button. For instructions and more detailed information about data types and filters, refer to each assistant’s user guide.
</p>
        <h2>Data Assistants</h2>
        <p>The following Data Assistants are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Barometric Compensation Assistant </b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bodyindent">- uses water pressure data from a HOBO U20 Water Level Logger and additional information from you to compensate for barometric pressure and create a water level or sensor depth series.

After you use the assistant and display the plot, you may apply filters to the new series.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Growing Degree Days Assistant</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bodyindent">- calculates growing degree days based on temperature data spanning at least one full calendar day (midnight to midnight). Growing degree days are used for agricultural and turf management applications, such as estimating harvest time or pest growth.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Grains Per Pound Assistant </b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bodyindent">- calculates the absolute amount of water in the air, based on temperature, humidity, dew point, and altitude. You can also create an altitude-corrected dew point series.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>kWh Assistant</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bodyindent">- converts logged pulse data from a WattNode, Veris, or other energy transducer to kWh, average kW, and energy cost. </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Pulse Scaling Assistant</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bodyindent">converts a data series from a compatible sensor to some other measurement when you enter a raw value and its corresponding measurement value. </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Linear Scaling Assistant</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bodyindent">- converts a data series from a compatible sensor to some other measurement when you enter two raw values and their corresponding measurement values. The conversion must be based on a linear relationship. Nonlinear scaling is not available.</p>
        <p>See the assistant's on-line help or user guide for more information.</p>
