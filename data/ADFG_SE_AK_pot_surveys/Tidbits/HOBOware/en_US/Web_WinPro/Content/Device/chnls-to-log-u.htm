            <h1>Channels to Log for Series Loggers</h1>
            <p>Select the data channels, if any, you want the logger to record.&#160;</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="">Only the sensors that are currently plugged in 
 or built into the logger are listed. If you add or remove sensors, click 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh</span> button to make sure 
 your changes are seen by the logger.&#160;</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="">Although it is helpful to see the connected sensors 
 when setting up the launch, it is not required that you connect the sensors 
 during launch set-up (though they do need to be connected if you want 
 to define locations or configure FlexSmart 
 modules or Analog Sensor Ports). You may set up the launch for a delayed or trigger start, 
 then connect the sensors later, before logging begins.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions=""><b>Important</b>:&#160;Sensors that are connected after logging begins will not log any data.</p>
        </p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">Guidelines</h2>
        <h3>RH/Pressure</h3>
        <p>Some loggers with RH or pressure sensors require 
 that you also select the internal temperature channel in order to log 
 relative humidity or pressure. Refer to the manual that came with your 
 logger for additional information.</p>
        <h3>Dew Point</h3>
        <p>When both the internal temperature and RH channels 
 are selected, dew point will be calculated automatically.</p>
        <h3>External Channels</h3>
        <p>For loggers with external channels, you must select 
 the part number of the sensor that is attached to ensure data is accurate 
 during logging. The sensor part number is listed on the shrink tube on 
 the sensor cable; make sure it matches the part number you select.</p>
        <p>If you select an external channel, but do not 
 plug the sensor in, false data will be recorded for that channel.</p>
        <h3>Event &amp; State Channels <span style="font-style: italic;">(not on all loggers)</span>&#160;</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">If external events and/or states are available for your logger supports , you can enter 
 names to identify the event and state channels that are in use. You can 
 also rename the Open and Closed descriptions for each state, and enter 
 increments and units for each event channel.</p>
        <h3>Utilities</h3>
        <p>If applicable, select a channel and click on the <a href="../scaling.htm">Scaling</a> 
 or <a href="../General/config-alarms.htm">Alarms</a> button in the Utilities section to configure scaling or alarms.</p>
        <h3>Battery Channel</h3>
        <p>You can select the logger's internal battery channel. 
 The logger's battery voltage is recorded at each sample time. </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Like the other data channels, logging the internal battery channel consumes 
 some of the logger's memory. Unless you suspect abnormal battery performance, 
 you probably do not need to log the battery voltage. A U-Series logger (other than a HOBO&#160;U30 Station) will record a bad battery event, even if it is not recording the battery 
 channel.</p>
