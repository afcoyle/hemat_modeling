        <p MadCap:conditions="">This topic describes the launch parameters you set in the Launch Window for U-Series Loggers.</p>

        <h3 MadCap:conditions=""> <![CDATA[ ]]>Logger Information</h3>
        <p><i>Logger Type</i>:&#160;Logger model and description.</p>
        <p><i>Serial Number</i>:Note that some external sensors also have 
 serial numbers, which are not listed here.</p>
        <p><i>Deployment Number</i>: Number of times (including this time) the logger has been launched. 
 Each time you start a new launch the deployment number increases by one.</p>
        <p><i>Battery</i> or <i>Battery Level</i>: Condition of the battery when you opened the Launch window. The indicator 
 varies depending on the logger model. For example, some loggers require 
 you to specify whether the battery is alkaline or lithium. Consult the 
 logger documentation for specifics on battery capacity.</p>
        <p><i style="font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Description</i>
        </p>
        <p>Enter a description for the launch, up to 40 characters, in this field.
 This description is used as the default file name when you read out and save the data recorded by the logger. It is also the title of the graph</p>
        <h3>Channels to Log</h3>
        <p> See <a href="../Device/chnls-to-log-st.htm">Channels to  Log Guidelines for Station Loggers</a>.</p>
        <h3>Logging Interval</h3>
        <p>Choose the rate at which you want the logger to record data. The minimum 
 logging interval is one second and the maximum for most loggers is 18 
 hours, 12 minutes, and 15 seconds. The shorter the logging interval, the 
 more quickly the memory fills and battery power is consumed.&#160;If you did not select any channels to log, this 
 field will be dimmed and unavailable.</p>
        <p>Also see <a href="../Device/Mlt-log-intv.htm">Multiple Logging Intervals</a> and  <a href="../Device/Fst_log_intv.htm">Fast Logging Intervals</a>.</p>
        <h3>Logging Duration</h3>
        <p>Approximate time it would take to fill the logger memory based on the 
 logging interval and currently enabled sensors, if applicable. <span style="font-style: italic;">This 
 is a theoretical estimate only;</span> battery life and frequent state 
 and event logging will affect your deployment. If you are logging only 
 state changes and events, no estimation is possible.</p>
        <h3>Launch Options</h3>
        <p>This indicates when to Launch the logger. The <span style="font-weight: normal;">Launch Option</span> defaults to 
 the setting for the logger's previous launch. To have all loggers default to the same launch option, see <a href="../Preferences/gp-lnch-ts.htm">Launch Time-Saving Options</a> (HOBOware Pro only).</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i>Now</i>:</span> Logging 
 begins as soon as you click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Launch</span> 
 button.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i>At Interval</i>:</span> Logging will begin at an exact interval (for example 9:00:00 rather than 
 8:47:00 when you choose a one-hour logging interval). The exact start 
 time depends on the logging interval you choose.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i>Delayed</i>:</span> Logging will begin at a date and time you specify, up to approximately 
 six months from the present.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor28"></a></span><i>Trigger</i>:  
 (Available only on certain loggers.) Logging will not start until you 
 press the button on the logger and hold it down for at least three seconds, 
 or return the logger to the coupler without the base station for at least 
 three seconds (refer to your logger manual for more information). If the 
 logger has a light, the light will flash quickly when logging begins.

        <h3>Skip launch window next time (HOBOware Pro only)&#160;</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">Check this box if you would like to bypass the Launch Window the next time 
 you choose <span style="font-weight: bold;">Launch</span> from the Device 
 menu or click the Launch icon. This will cause the next 
 logger to be launched with default settings, as determined by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fill launch window with contents of</span> 
 preference.&#160;To turn this setting off so that you can access 
 the Launch window again, go to <b>Preferences </b>&gt; <b>General </b>&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Launch 
 Time-Saving Options</span> and in the <i>When Launching</i> drop-down list select "Show launch screen". </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">To always use the settings from the logger's memory, you can 
 return to the default setting by going to <b>Preferences </b>&gt; <b>General </b>&gt;&#160;<b>Launch Time-Saving Options</b> and choose 
 <span style="font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">Fill launch window with contents of Current 
 logger</span>.</p>
