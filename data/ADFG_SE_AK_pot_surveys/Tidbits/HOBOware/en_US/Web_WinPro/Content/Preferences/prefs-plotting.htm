        <h1>Plotting Preferences</h1>
        <p>You can set the following Plotting Preferences:</p>
        <h2>Fonts
</h2>
        <h3>Font Size for Plots

</h3>
        <p>Controls the size of most text on the graph. The default is 9 points, but you can also choose 8, 10, 11, 12, or 14. The plot title will default to two points larger than the selected font size.

</p>
        <h2>Layout

    </h2>
        <h3>Show the details pane when plotting data.
</h3>
        <p>HOBOware Pro: By default, the Details pane is not open when you display a plot. If you want the Details pane to be hidden when you display a plot, clear this box.

</p>
        <p>HOBOware Lite: By default, the Details pane is not open when you display a plot. If you want the Details pane to be shown when you display a plot, check this box.
</p>
        <h3>Show the points table when plotting data.
</h3>
        <p>HOBOware Pro:By default, the Points table is open when you display a plot. If you want the Points table to be hidden when you display a plot, clear this box.

</p>
        <p>HOBOware Lite: By default, the Points table is not open when you display a plot. If you want the Points table to be shown when you display a plot, check this box.
</p>
        <h2>Points Table &amp; Details Pane
</h2>
        <h3>Include sensor Location (if available) in points table and details pane (HOBOware Pro Only).</h3>
        <p> This setting adds the sensor's location string, if it has a location defined, to each column header in the Points table and to the Details pane. This is especially useful if you have data that includes similarly-named series that were recorded on different sensors; for example, a HOBO Micro Station datafile with data from three voltage sensors.
</p>
        <h3>When selected value in table is out of plot range, drag series to that value. </h3>
        <p>Normally, if you are zoomed in and click a point in the Points table that is outside the zoom area, will scroll the marked point into view while retaining your zoom factor. Clear this box if you do not want to scroll.
</p>
        <h2>Gridlines

    </h2>
        <h3>Enable horizontal gridlines when plotting data.
</h3>
        <p>By default, horizontal gridlines are not displayed when you open a plot. Enable this option if you always want a new plot to display gridlines for all value axes.
</p>
        <h3>Enable vertical gridlines when plotting data.
</h3>
        <p>By default, vertical gridlines are always displayed when you open a plot. Clear this checkbox if you never want a new plot to display gridlines for the time axis.

</p>
        <h2>Plot Setup
</h2>
        <h3> Automatically select all data series for plotting

</h3>
        <p>By default, when you read out a logger or open a datafile, some series (such as Dew Point) are not selected for display on the Plot Setup dialog. Enable this option if you want every series to be selected.
</p>
        <h3>Automatically select internal events for plotting (e.g. Button Up/Down, Host Connected, EOF)</h3>
        <p>When you open a plot, internal events are selected by default on the Plot Setup dialog. Clear this box if you usually do not want to see these events.

</p>
        <h2>Other Options

    </h2>
        <h3>Mark all points when plotting data

</h3>
        <p>By default, when you display a plot, point markers are displayed for any series with event data. Otherwise, to avoid cluttering the graph, point markers are not displayed. Enable this option if you want all points to be marked on every series whenever you display a plot. On a large plot, marking all points takes longer and consumes more system memory.

      Series that consist of only one point are always marked.
    </p>
        <h3>Label the time axis

</h3>
        <p>By default, the time axis is not labeled when you display a plot. If you enable this preference, the time axis will have a default name of "Time" when you open a plot.
</p>
        <h3>Use sensor locations (if available)&#160;in legend</h3>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>When plotting multiple series of the same unit type:
</h3>
        <p>By default, if there are multiple series of the same unit type (for example, temperature and dew point series in degrees Fahrenheit), plots all of the series in the same color, and uses a different line style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) for each. </p>
        <p>Choose <i>Use a different color for each series</i> if you prefer each series to have a solid line in a different color. The series will still be attached to a single, common axis, but only one series will match the axis color.</p>
