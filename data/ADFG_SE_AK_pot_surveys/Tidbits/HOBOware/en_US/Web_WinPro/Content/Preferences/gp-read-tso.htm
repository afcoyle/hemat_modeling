        <h1>Readout Time-Saving Options</h1>
        <p>The following options are configurable by going to <b>File </b>&gt;&#160;<b>Preferences&#160;</b>&gt;&#160;<b>General</b> &gt;&#160;<b>Readout Time-Saving Options</b>.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">When saving datafile</p>
        <p>By default, HOBOware Pro displays a save dialog after you read out a file. This allows you to specify a location and name for the file, or decline to save the file. If you want to skip the save dialog, choose Automatically save. The file will be saved automatically with a default name (based on the launch description) and in the default location.</p>
        <p><b>When plotting</b>
        </p>
        <p>By default, after reading out a logger and being prompted to save the datafile, HOBOware Pro displays the Plot Setup dialog. To bypass this dialog (including Data Assistants) and plot automatically, choose Automatically plot. To skip the dialog without displaying the plot (useful if you are reading out many loggers now and prefer to look at the plots later), choose Do not plot.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Ask to stop logging before reading out a running logger</p>
        <p>When this option is selected, a prompt appears every time you read out a logger that is logging, asking whether you want to stop the logger or let it continue logging data during readout. If this option is not selected, the logger will always continue logging during readout.</p>
        <h2>Reading Out Multiple Loggers</h2>
        <p>When used in conjunction with a Default Action of Readout, the Readout Time-Saving Options allow you to read out many U-Series loggers in a row simply by plugging and unplugging individual loggers.

To do this, set these options as follows:

When saving datafile: Automatically save
When plotting: Do not plot
Ask to stop logging...: Disabled (unchecked)

Then, from the Device menu, choose a Default Action of Readout. (The Default Action will reset to Do Nothing the next time you start HOBOware Pro.)</p>
