        <h1>Basic Task Details</h1>
        <p>This topic provides details on the steps in the <a href="basic-process.htm">Summary of Tasks</a> topic.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Launch Logger</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bodyindent">To set up a logger to record data, you must specify several parameters 
 and start or launch the logger.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent">See <a href="../Device/launch-device.htm">Overview of Launching a Device</a> for more information.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li value="2">Readout Data</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bodyindent">After connecting the logger to a computer running HOBOware, you select Device &gt;&#160;Readout from the Main Menu to readout the data from the logger. For more information see <a href="../Device/readout.htm">Reading Out Data from a Logger</a>.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent">After the logger is readout, HOBOware prompts you to save the datafile.  Although you can save a project file without 
 saving the original datafile, Onset strongly recommends saving datafiles so that you will always have access to the original data that was read out from the logger.
</p>
        <p class="bodyindent">Accept the default location and name, or enter a new name and click Save.
By default, the data is saved in the HOBOware folder located in your My Documents folder (or Documents folder on a Mac). If you decline to save the datafile, the plot is displayed with a name like "Untitled 
 1*" on the tab. The asterisk signifies that the data has not been 
 saved. To save the logger data as a datafile, from the File menu, select          <![CDATA[ ]]><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save 
 Datafile</span>. You can only save the data to a datafile once.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li value="3">Plot data</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bodyindent">After you readout a logger, the <b>Plot Setup</b> dialog appears. Select and define the series you want to plot, change the default define units and timezone if required, and click <b>Plot</b>. The plot, which includes a graph, a Details Pane, and a Points table, appears. </p>
        <p class="bodyindent">For more information see <a href="../Graphs/plotting-data.htm">Setting up a Plot</a>.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li value="4">Analyze Data</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bodyindent">Use HOBOware tools to analyze the plot. </p>
        <p class="bodyindent">See <a href="../Graphs/convert-units.htm">Converting Units</a>.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li value="5">Save Project</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bodyindent">A project file (.hproj) is a plot that you have customized using the various features and tools of HOBOware. When you open a project file, the plot 
 appears as it did when you saved the project file, and contains all of 
 the same data.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent">Changes that you make to the appearance or content of the plot are not 
 retained when you save the datafile. For example, if you have pasted series 
 from another plot, created new axes and zoomed in, those changes will 
 be lost unless you save them in a project file.&#160;</p>
        <p class="bodyindent">To save your current data with a customized view of the plot, click 
 the Save icon <img src="../Resources/Images/save.gif"></img> on the toolbar, or choose <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save 
 Project</span> from the File menu. To open an existing project file, choose 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open Project</span> from the File menu.</p>
