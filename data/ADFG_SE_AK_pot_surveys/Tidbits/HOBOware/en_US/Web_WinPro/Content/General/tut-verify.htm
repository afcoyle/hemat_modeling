        <p>Your screen will not match this example exactly, but you should see Button Up and Button Down events (if applicable) and the graph should reflect the change in conditions that you caused in step 6.</p>
        <p>View the results of your deployment. You should 
 see Button Up and Button Down events (if applicable) and the graph should 
 reflect the change in conditions that you caused above.&#160;</p>
        <p>In HOBOware Pro, the Details Pane and the Points table are shown by default. To view them in HOBOware Lite, go to the View menu and select <span style="font-weight: normal;">them</span>. The <a href="../Reference/details.htm" MadCap:conditions="">Details pane</a> appears 
 to the left of the graph, and the <a href="../Graphs/points.htm" MadCap:conditions="">Points 
 table</a> appears above the graph. These panes provide additional information 
 about your data. To hide these panes, go back to the View menu and choose 
 them again.</p>
        <p>Use the plotting tools on the <a href="../Reference/Toolbar_icons.htm">toolbar</a> 
 to experiment with the many viewing and customization tools available 
 within HOBOware. 
 Pause the pointer over each icon on the toolbar for a description of each 
 tool. </p>
