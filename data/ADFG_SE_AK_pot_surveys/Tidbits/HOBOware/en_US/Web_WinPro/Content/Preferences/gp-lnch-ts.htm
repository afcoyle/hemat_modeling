        <h1>Launch Time-Saving Options (HOBOware Pro Only)</h1>
        <h3 type="disc" MadCap:conditions=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">When launching</span>
        </h3>
        <p type="disc" MadCap:conditions="">By default, HOBOware Pro displays the launch window when you initiate a launch. If you want to skip the launch window and launch the logger with the default settings, choose Automatically launch. 
This is particularly useful if you want to launch many loggers quickly without changing any settings.
The default settings are determined by the Fill launch window with contents of setting.
</p>
        <p type="disc" MadCap:conditions="">For HOBOware Pro Only: When used in conjunction with a <b>Default Action</b> of <i>Launch </i><b>(Device </b>menu), this feature allows you to launch many U-Series loggers in a row simply by plugging and unplugging individual loggers.
</p>
        <h3 type="disc" MadCap:conditions=""><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor42"></a>Fill launch window 
 with contents of</span>
        </h3>
        <p type="disc" MadCap:conditions="">A logger's memory contains the most recent launch 
 settings for that logger. These settings normally become the defaults 
 for the logger's next launch (the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Current 
 logger</span> option). However, if you plan to launch several loggers 
 of the same model with similar settings, you can change this preference 
 to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Previous launch</span>. This will 
 fill the launch window with the settings from the previous logger that 
 was launched.
        </p>
        <p type="disc" MadCap:conditions="">This is particularly useful 
 if you want to set up many loggers to start at the same time and with 
 the same logging interval. An indicator on the <b>Launch </b>window will remind 
 you when this preference is in use.</p>
        <p type="disc" MadCap:conditions="">If the logger you are launching 
 is a different model from the previous logger, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Previous 
 launch</span> does not apply. HOBOware Pro will use the settings in the 
 logger's memory, and those values will become the default for the next 
 logger if it is the same model.</p>
        <h3 type="disc" MadCap:conditions=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">Default launch 
 type</span>
        </h3>
        <p type="disc" MadCap:conditions="">This option allows you to set the default starting mode to:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li type="disc" MadCap:conditions="" value="1">Previous Launch type</li>
            <li type="disc" MadCap:conditions="" value="2">Launch now
</li>
            <li type="disc" MadCap:conditions="" value="3">Launch at interval
</li>
            <li type="disc" MadCap:conditions="" value="4">Delayed launch
</li>
            <li type="disc" MadCap:conditions="" value="5">Triggered start
</li>
        </ul>
        <p type="disc" MadCap:conditions="">If you want to always default to a specific launch option, choose that option from the list.
The default is <b>Previous launch type</b>, meaning that the launch option will default to the option used for the logger's previous launch. (Exception: if the previous launch was a Launch at interval start, the next launch will default to a delayed start.) </p>
        <p type="disc" MadCap:conditions=""><b>Important</b>: If you choose Triggered start as the default launch type, and then launch a logger that does not offer a trigger start option, the launch option will default to Launch now.
</p>
        <p type="disc" MadCap:conditions="">If you set the Fill launch window with contents of preference to Previous launch, the Default launch type will be ignored in favor of the launch type from the last launch.
