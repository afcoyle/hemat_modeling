        <h1><a name="kanchor73"></a>Setting Series Properties</h1>
        <p><a name="kanchor74"></a>A series is the group of data points for the sensor measurement, state, 
 or event you selected to display in the plot. </p>
        <p>To change series properties, 
 double-click the series you wish to modify or select the series and 
 click the Properties icon <img src="../Resources/Images/properties.gif" /> on the main menu.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The following options are <a href="#">Setting Series Properties</a> available on the Series Properties dialog:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Description<span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> 
 Enter up to a 40-character name for the series. The series name is displayed 
 in the legend. The default name for a series with sensor data is the property 
 that was measured and the units used to display the measurements. The 
 default name for a series with event or state data is the type of event 
 or state. </li>
            <li value="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Units<span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> 
 Enter the unit type in this field, if it is different from the default. 
 If, while viewing the plot, you convert to another type of unit, the text 
 you enter here will change to the default name for the unit you chose. </li>
            <li value="3">Lines
Section </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor75"></a></span>Connect Points<span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span><a name="kanchor76"></a> 
 Toggles whether the points in this series are connected. This option is 
 selected by default for most series; it is not selected for internal logger 
 events. </p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Style<span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> 
 Changes the appearance of the line used to connect the points in a series. 
 The default varies depending on how many series measuring the same property 
 are being viewed.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Width<span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> 
 Changes the size or weight of the line used to connect the points in a 
 series. The default is 1 point.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Connect as Steps<span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> 
 Toggles whether the lines between the points in a series are connected 
 as a curve or a step. When this option is selected, the line drawn between 
 points keeps the value of the previous point until the next point in the 
 series. This is useful for state or event graphs. This option is not selected 
 by default for sensor series.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li value="4">Alarms Section</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor77"></a></span>Enable Alarms<span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> 
 Alarms are available for sensor measurement series only,  not state 
 or event series.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent">Enabling alarms will show lines on 
 the graph for this series, to indicate 
 a visual threshold over or under which data may be falling (for example, 
 if you want to quickly see how many points fall below 32 degrees). Alarms are turned off by default. </p>
        <p type="circle" class="bodyindent">For <span style="font-weight: normal;">High 
 Alarm</span>, enter a value relative to the series where you want the 
 maximum (red) alarm line to appear.</p>
        <p type="circle" class="bodyindent">For <span style="font-weight: normal;">Low 
 Alarm</span>, enter a value relative to the series where you want the 
 minimum (blue) alarm line to appear.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li value="5">Points Section</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor78"></a></span>Mark Points<span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> If you enable Mark Points a marker appears at each data point in this series. By 
 default, this option is selected for any series with event data or only 
 one point. To avoid cluttering the graph, it is not selected by default 
 for other series.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Marker<span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> 
 Changes the shape of the marker used. The default marker varies depending 
 on how many series are being viewed.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Point size:</span> 
 Changes the point size for the marker. </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li type="circle" value="6">Miscellaneous Section</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor79"></a></span>Time Axis<span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> 
 Allows you to create an additional time axis for this series. This is 
 useful when you want to compare data from two different time periods.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Value Axis<span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> 
 Changes the axis being used for the series. Choose one of the axes already 
 in view, or select <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Value Axis</span> 
 from the dropdown list to create your own.</p>
        <p class="bodyindent"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Color<span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span> 
 Changes the color used for the series. The default color varies depending 
 on how many series are displayed on the graph.</p>
