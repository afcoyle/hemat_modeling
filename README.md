# hemat_modeling

This repository is used to work on modeling _Hematodinium_ infection rates in various systems.

This originates from a QERM 514 project, in which data from the southeastern Alaska Tanner crab pot survey was used to model _Hematodinium_ infection rates. That model and the process of creating it can be found at https://github.com/afcoyle/QERM514_project
