 as tabs so that you can see the file name of each open plot (or "Untitled*" 
 for an unsaved datafile). You can also get to this view by clicking the 
 Tabs icon  in the lower left of the  window.</p>

        <p class="bodyindent">Arranges 
 up to five plots horizontally. If six or more plots are open, they will 
 be tiled as a grid. You can also get to this view by clicking the Horizontal 
 Tile icon  in the lower left of the window.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li value="3">Tile Vertically</li>

        <p class="bodyindent">Arranges up

 tiled as a grid. You can also get to this view by clicking the Vertical 
 Tile icon  in the lower left of the window.</p>
        <h2>Multiple Views&#160;</h2>
        <p>You can open 
 the same datafile multiple times to create different views of the graph, 
 then use the Tile commands on the <b>Window </b>menu (or resize and move the 
 windows manually) to see all of them at once. This is helpful if you want 
 to zoom in on several different areas and view them side-by-side, see 
 the detail of a small area while the full graph is still in view, or view 
 each series in a different window.</p>
