        <h1>Current Readings</h1>
        <p>This topic describes the elements of the Current Readings section of the Status window.
</p>
        <h3>Screen Refresh Interval </h3>
        <p>Frequency with which the Current Readings are updated, up to 3600 seconds (one hour). A higher number means less stress on the logger's battery. The Status icon blinks when the readings are updated.
</p>
        <p>Note: For event/state loggers, the interval is set to 0.5 seconds and cannot be adjusted. This ensures that you do not miss events and state changes that take place between refreshes.
</p>
        <h3>Tilt meters (not labeled)
</h3>
        <p>For acceleration loggers only, color-coded meters display X, Y, and Z-axis tilt (relative to vertical, assuming that the only acceleration force on the logger is gravity) graphically.
</p>
        <h3>Sensor Readings

</h3>
        <p>Sensor readings, updated in real time. </p>
        <h2>NOTES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Readings are displayed for all available sensors, even if they are not being logged. If a channel is not being logged, its name is dimmed in the display.



      
</li>
            <li value="2">If a logger has channels for external sensors, a description and reading will be given for the external channels even if no sensors are plugged in.
    </li>
            <li value="3">If a U-Series logger (other than a HOBO U30 Station) has channels for external sensors, a description and reading will be given for the external channels even if no sensors are plugged in.
    </li>
            <li value="4">For event loggers, the event count in the Current Readings box will always start at zero, even if many events have already been logged.
</li>
            <li value="5">(HOBOware Pro) For station loggers, the location (if defined) is displayed next to the reading.    </li>
            <li value="6">(HOBOware Pro) If a HOBO U30 Station has an Analog Sensor Port, readings for one or both channels are displayed.</li>
            <li value="7">(HOBOware Pro) The RSSI (Signal Level) is displayed for the HOBO U30/GSM Station. This helps you determine if there is enough signal strength in the current location for the HOBO U30 Station to contact a cellular tower for connecting with HOBOlink. Signal level is measured on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no signal, 1 being a weak signal, and 10 being a strong signal.
</li>
            <li value="8">The battery voltage is displayed for some loggers.
</li>
        </ul>
