# 2007

Tidbit 20-07 is listed as Tidbit 20_07 in the database. It's shown as Tidbit 20 in the pot set data file (both the full pot set file and the year-specific one), but in the comments it notes "TB 20-07", "Tidbit 2007", etc. Will need to move all variants over.

Within pot set data for the full year, all files describing a Tidbit ending in -07 in the comments don't have an accompanying Tidbit file. In fact, no Tidbit within 2007 has a Tidbit number.

When naming the Tidbit files, we'll strip the 07 part from all except 20_07. This is because for the most part, there aren't duplicates (ex: there's both Tidbit 18-07 and Tidbit 18 in the comments, but only one Tidbit 18 file). The one exception is 20_07. For the sake of consistency, we'll rename it to 20-07.txt
