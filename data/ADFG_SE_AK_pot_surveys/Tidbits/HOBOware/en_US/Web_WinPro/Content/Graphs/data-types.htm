        <h1>Data Types in Plots</h1>
        <p>Four kinds of data can be displayed on a plot:</p>
        <h3>Sensor measurements</h3>
        <p>Sensor measurements include 
 the channels you selected to log at an interval during the launch, such 
 as temperature, RH, or battery voltage. This type of data series consists 
 of all the logged data points for that channel. In addition, if the logger 
 recorded both temperature and RH, a dew point series can be plotted.</p>
        <h3>States</h3>
        <p>States are condition changes 
 that can be recorded at any time during deployment, regardless of the 
 logging interval (if any). Only state loggers, such as the U9 and U11, 
 can record state changes.</p>
        <h3>External Events</h3>
        <p>External Events are momentary switch closures (e.g., from turnstiles) that 
 are recorded by loggers with external event channels, such as the U11 
 logger.</p>
        <h3>Internal logger Events</h3>
        <p>Internal Logger Events are individually-logged occurrences that can be recorded at any time during 
 deployment, regardless of the logging interval. U-Series loggers (Other than the HOBO&#160;U30 Station) record 
 internal logger events.</p>
        <p>Examples of internal logger events include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">End of File:</span> 
 Marks the last record that was found in the logger.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bad Battery:</span> 
 Time the battery capacity fell to an extremely low level (if applicable). If you see a Bad Battery event, replace the battery before deploying the 
 logger again.</li>
            <li value="3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stopped:</span> 
 Time the logger was manually stopped with HOBOware.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Host Connected:</span> 
 Time the logger was connected to the computer.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="5"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor48"></a>Coupler Connected/Coupler 
 Disconnected:</span> Time the logger was connected or disconnected from 
 the coupler, if the logger uses a coupler to communicate with the computer.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Button Down/Button 
 Up:</span> For U-Series loggers that 
 have event buttons, each button push of at least one second is logged as a Button 
 Down event and a Button Up event.</li>
            <li class="sp_bull" value="7"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interval Change:</span> 
 For loggers that can be configured with multiple logging intervals, an Interval Change 
 event marks the moment when a new logging interval began.</li>
        </ul>
